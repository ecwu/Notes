# Chapter 3: SQL

## Data Definition

### Domain Types

- **char(_n_)**: **Fixed length character string**, w/ user-specified length _n_
- **varchar(_n_)**: **Variable length character string**, w/ user-specified maximum length _n_
- **int**: **Integer** (_machine dependent_)
- **smallint**: **Small integer** (_machine dependent_)
- **numeric(_p, d_)**: **Fixed point number**, w/ user-specified precision of _p_ digits, _n_ digits to the right of decimal point
- **real / double**: **Floating point number** (single-precision / double-precision, _machine dependent_)
- **float(_n_)**: **Floating point number**, w/ user-specified precision of _at least_ _n_ digits

### Create Table Construct

```sql
CREATE TABLE r (
  A1 CHAR(15) NOT NULL,
  A2 char(30),
  A3 INTEGER
)
```

#### Integrity Constraints in Create Table

### Drop and Alter Table Constructs

```sql
DROP TABLE r -- Deletes all information in r
ALTER TABLE r ADD A D -- Add attribute A whose domain is D to r
ALTER TABLE r DROP A  -- Drop attribute A in r (not supported by many databases)
```

## Basic Query Structure

### `SELECT` Clause

Lists attributes desired in the result of a query

- **Duplicates are being kept!**

```sql
SELECT branch_name FROM loan -- Select branch_name from relationship loan
SELECT DISTINCT branch_name FROM loan -- Dedup branch_name
SELECT ALL branch_name FROM loan -- Do not dedup
SELECT * FROM loan -- Select ALL ATTRIBUTES from relationship loan
SELECT loan_number, branch_name, amount * 100 FROM loan -- Can have arithmetic operations!
```

### `FROM` Clause

Lists the relations involved in the query. (Corresponds to _Cartesian Product_)

```sql
SELECT customer_name, borrower.loan_number, amount
  FROM borrower, loan
  WHERE borrower.loan_number = loan.loan_number AND
    branch_name = 'Foo'
```

### `WHERE` Clause

Specifies conditions that the result must satisfy.

```sql
SELECT loan_number
FROM loan
WHERE branch_name = 'Foo' AND amount > 1200 -- AND, OR and NOT can be used
```

#### `BETWEEN`

```sql
SELECT loan_number
FROM loan
WHERE amount BETWEEN 90000 AND 100000
```

### `AS`

**Rename Operation**.

```sql
old_name AS new_name
-- or
old_name new_name
```

### Tuple Variables

Defined in `FROM` clause via the use of `AS` clause.

- `AS` here can be omitted

### String Operations

Operator `LIKE` uses patterns to match:

- `%`: Any substring
- `_`: Any character

e.g.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM customer
WHERE street LIKE '%Bar\%' ESCAPE '\\' -- Specifying escape character
```

### Ordering

```sql
ORDER BY name -- ASC (Ascending) is the default
ORDER BY name DESC
```

### Duplicates

...

## Set Operations

```sql
r UNION s     -- Union
r INTERSECT s -- Intersection
r EXCEPT s    -- Set difference
```

To retain duplicates, append `ALL`. Suppose a tuple occurs _m_ times in _r_ and _n_ times in _s_, then it occurs:

- **m + n** times in `r UNION ALL s`
- **min(m, n)** times in `r INTERSECT ALL s`
- **max(0, m - n)** times in `r EXCEPT ALL s`

## Aggregate Functions

- `avg`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `count`

### Group By & Having

```sql
SELECT foo, avg(bar)
FROM Baz
WHERE Baz.ipsum = Lorem.ipsum -- This evaluates before grouping
GROUP BY foo
HAVING avg(bar) > 25252       -- This evaluates after grouping
```

**Note:** The evaluation sequence of `WHERE`, `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` is:

1. `WHERE`
2. `GROUP BY`
3. `HAVING`
