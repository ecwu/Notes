# Lecture 8: Microarchitecture

## ISA and Microarchitecture

- ISA is the interface of a processor as seen by an assembly language programmer or compiler writer
- Micro-architecture transfers the ISA into an implementation
- For a given ISA, there might be many different microarchitectures
- Architecture is a collection of circuits connected together

## Memory
