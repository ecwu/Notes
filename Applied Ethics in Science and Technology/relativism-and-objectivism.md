# Ethical Theories: Relativism & Objectivism

## Ethical Relativism

- There is no universally accepted ethical standard
  - Different cultures have different ethical standards
  - There is no objective standard of right or wrong (unlike natural sciences)
  - "Personal ethical relativism"
  - "Social ethical relativism"
- Reasons for ethical relativism
  - Diversity of moral views
  - Moral uncertainty
  - Situation differences
- Morality is a set of believe individual or society have, nothing more
  - Any problem with this theory?
